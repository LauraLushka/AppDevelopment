GEN AI USAGE DECLARATION 
Tool: ChatGPT-4 (March 2024 version)
Purpose: Targeted assistance with specific technical challenges

1. PROMPT: How to efficiently filter datetime ranges in lubridate for Uber pickup data?
   - Used: parse_date_time() implementation approach
   - Modifications: Added error handling for malformed timestamps
 2. PROMPT: Leaflet heatmap rendering too slowly with 50k points - optimization options?

      - Changed sample_n() from 50k â†’ 20k points
      - Adjusted radius/blur based on NYC density testing
      - Added conditional subsampling (if nrow > 20k)
 3. PROMPT: Best way to calculate geographic clusters without specialized spatial packages?
    - Context: Needed simple hotspot detection for assignment constraints
    - Used: Coordinate rounding method explanation
    - Modifications:
      - Implemented round(Lat/Lon, 3) instead of suggested round(.,2)
      - Added human-readable location labels (Downtown/Uptown)
